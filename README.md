## About that Project

This project is part of the course "Web Development: Architectures, Frameworks". A simplified "Corona Vaccination Service" was implemented for the project. It should be possible for administrators to create a vaccination date in the system and for those willing to be vaccinated to register for a vaccination.


## Implementation

The backend was implemented with Laravel. In the process, the DB layers, the business logic and the corresponding REST API were implemented in Laravel.

The corresponding frontend was implemented with Angular. This frontend enables the creation of vaccination dates, the summary of the data to be transmitted and the overview and detailed view with registered persons for vaccination administrators. In addition, the vaccination administrator can check off a vaccination administered to a person.
